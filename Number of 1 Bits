Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
    
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
           count+=n&1;
            n>>=1;
        }
        return count;
    }
    
}
